# E05b-Physics
Here we did a couple of things such as having balls no longer stay still but instead bounce around.(This was for main1.py)Then I took the the balls and made them fall to the ground using gravity.(This was for main2.py) Then lastly without doing the extra credit I took these animals that were bouncing around and made them bounce off of each other.(This was for main3.py)
